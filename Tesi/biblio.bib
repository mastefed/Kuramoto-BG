	abstract = {Abstract The classification of movement disorders has evolved. Even the terminology has shifted, from an anatomical one of extrapyramidal disorders to a phenomenological one of movement disorders. The history of how this shift came about is described. The history of both the definitions and the classifications of the various neurologic conditions is then reviewed. First is a review of movement disorders as a group; then, the evolving classifications for 3 of them---parkinsonism, dystonia, and tremor---are covered in detail. {\copyright} 2011 Movement Disorder Society},

@article{vissani,
	abstract = {Objective. Deep brain stimulation (DBS) is an established and valid therapy for a variety of pathological conditions ranging from motor to cognitive disorders. Still, much of the DBS-related mechanism of action is far from being understood, and there are several side effects of DBS whose origin is unclear. In the last years DBS limitations have been tackled by a variety of approaches, including adaptive deep brain stimulation (aDBS), a technique that relies on using chronically implanted electrodes on `sensing mode' to detect the neural markers of specific motor symptoms and to deliver on-demand or modulate the stimulation parameters accordingly. Here we will review the state of the art of the several approaches to improve DBS and summarize the main challenges toward the development of an effective aDBS therapy. Approach. We discuss models of basal ganglia disorders pathogenesis, hardware and software improvements for conventional DBS, and candidate neural and non-neural features and related control strategies for aDBS. Main results. We identify then the main operative challenges toward optimal DBS such as (i) accurate target localization, (ii) increased spatial resolution of stimulation, (iii) development of in silico tests for DBS, (iv) identification of specific motor symptoms biomarkers, in particular (v) assessing how LFP oscillations relate to behavioral disfunctions, and (vi) clarify how stimulation affects the cortico-basal-ganglia-thalamic network to (vii) design optimal stimulation patterns. Significance. This roadmap will lead neural engineers novel to the field toward the most relevant open issues of DBS, while the in-depth readers might find a careful comparison of advantages and drawbacks of the most recent attempts to improve DBS-related neuromodulatory strategies.},

@article{montgomery,
	abstract = {Current theories of basal ganglia (BG) function based on suppression of activity in the ventrolateral thalamic-cortical circuits by the globus pallidus internal segment are inconsistent with accumulating evidence, demonstrating the need for reconsideration. Changes in busting, oscillatory and synchronous neuronal activities have been indicted as pathophyisological mechanisms but they are unaccompanied by any mechanistic explanatory theory and rely on the same basic assumptions as previous theories now suspect. These notions and theories are reviewed and an alternative is proposed. The systems oscillators theory presented here proposes that the BG is a network of sets of interconnected closed neural loops functioning as oscillators. Its unique physiological and pathophysiological mechanisms are explored.},

@article{milardi,
	abstract = {Much of our present understanding of the function and operation of the basal ganglia rests on models of anatomical connectivity derived from tract-tracing approaches in rodents and primates. However, the last years have been characterized by promising step forwards in the in vivo investigation and comprehension of brain connectivity in humans. The aim of this review is to revise the current knowledge on basal ganglia circuits, highlighting similarities and differences across species, in order to widen the current perspective on the intricate model of the basal ganglia system. This will allow us to explore the implications of additional direct pathways running from cortex to basal ganglia and between basal ganglia and cerebellum recently described in animals and humans.},
